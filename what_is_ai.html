<h1>So, <em>only</em> neural networks are AI?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Well, maybe not, but...
</h5>

<p>
  You've probably heard a bunch of different terms associated with
  artifical intelligence, some of the most common being "deep learning"
  and "machine learning". Like many concepts, the meanings of these
  terms are fuzzy and can change depending on your perspective. Based
  solely on a general semantic point of view, we could reasonably define
  "artificial intelligence" as any system that mimics
  natural intelligence using computers. Of course, then we'd need to define
  natural intelligence! Historically, we generally think of an AI as
  'useful' if it can perform as good as or better than a professional human
  at a given task.
</p>

<p>
  But continuing on, "machine learning" could be defined as a type of
  "artificial intelligence" that works by providing training data to the
  computer and allowing the computer to 'learn' how to be 'intelligent'
  by analyzing the training data. If we continue along this general
  semantic path, "deep learning" could be reasonably defined as
  a specific type of "machine learning"
  that uses very large (or "deep") stacks of neural network layers to
  learn from training data.
</p>

<p>
  Semantically, these definitions basically make sense and organize
  AI-related concepts into an "is a" hierarchy: deep learning <em>is a</em>
  type of machine learning approach, which in turn <em>is a</em> type of
  artificial intelligence. This conceptual organization allows us
  to draw an organizational diagram like the one below, which clearly
  illustrates the "is a" hierarchy based on set-overlaps.
</p>

<img src="media/ai_venn.png" alt="deep learning is a machine learing is an artificial intelligence" width="500">

<p>
  From a conceptual or theoretical perspective, we have defined many of
  the core terms commonly associated with AI nowadays, and we even have
  a clear and concise diagram to help us organize these ideas.
</p>

<p>
  However, this conceptual perspective can easily get us into big trouble
  'in the field', when we try to apply AI-related ideas to analyze real data
  and address real complex problems. This trouble arises primarily because
  our conceptual organization provides little guidance to help us decide
  how to choose a methodology or approach that is suitable to a specific
  problem, and it fails to coincide with how we generally think about the
  practical advantages and disadvantages of different types of methods
  commonly associated with "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"
  and "deep learning".
</p>

<p>
  If we take a <em>practical</em> perspective, what we want to be able to
  do 'in the field' is to make accurate and reliable inferences from data.
  To do so, we need some guidance to help us select the appropriate inference
  method, given the data we expect to have and the complexity of the
  inference we would like to make.
</p>

<p>
  The first thing we need to accept is that <em>all</em> reliable
  data-driven inferences
  rely on statistical analysis. Whether you're doing a basic t-test with 2
  degrees of freedom or taining a 43-million-parameter inception network,
  you are doing statistical data analysis.
</p>

<p>
  Once we accept that reliable data analysis is built on statistics, we can
  start to use concepts from statistics to organize AI-related terms. For
  example, "machine learning" is simply a general approach for fitting a
  statistical model to your data. And "deep learning" is just fitting a
  big, complex neural-network model to your data. Statistically, 'fitting'
  just means optimizing the parameters of the model so they minimize a
  user-defined 'loss function'. So, from a statistical perspective, 'learning'
  is not that magical; it just means that you are optimizing your model's
  fit to some specific data, given your loss function.
</p>

<p>
  As an example, let's consider a simple linear model:
</p>

<pre class='language-none'>
y = m * x + b
</pre>

<p>
  This linear model relates two variables, x and y. Given a value for x, the
  model calculates the corresponding y value using two "free parameters": m
  and b, where
  m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept (ie, the value of y when
  x is zero).
</p>

<p>
  The free parameters of the model, m and b, are unspecified; they can take
  on any values we'd like, but we can't use the model until we figure out
  what values we should choose for m and b. So, how do we choose appropriate
  values for m and b?
</p>

<p>
  Given some 'training data': examples of 'real' x,y pairs, we can 'learn'
  the appropriate values for m and b by 'fitting' our linear model to the
  training data. How do we do this? Let's start by plugging in some 'random'
  values for m and b:
</p>

<pre class='language-none'>
y = 2.4851 * x + -18.3284
</pre>

<p>
  Now our linear model is fully-specified; we can use it to calculate the
  corresponding y value for any value of x. But is the model any good?
</p>

<p>
  To determine how good our fully-specified model is, we take the x values
  from the training data, use our model to calculate the corresponding
  predicted y
  values (often denoted y&#770;, or "y-hat"), and then see how 'close' our
  predicted y&#770; values are to the 'true' corresponding y values in
  our training data.
</p>

<p>
  The user-specified "loss function" quantifies how 'close'
  our predicted y&#770; values are to the true y values in the training
  data. We can use any loss function
  we'd like, the most common in this case probably being root-mean-square
  deviation, or
  "RMSD". We won't worry about how RMSD is calculated right now. What matters
  is that the loss function, whatever it is, quantifies how 'good' or 'bad'
  our model is at predicting the true y values from the corresponding x values
  in our training data. We can then keep trying new values for the free
  parameters in our model (m and b, in this case), until the loss function
  is as small as we can possibly make it.
</p>

<p>
  Once we have found the values for m and b that minimize the loss function,
  given our training data, we say our model has been 'fit' to the training
  data. Alternatively, we could say that our model has 'learned' the
  best-fit values for m and b from the training data.
</p>

<p>
  Really, that's all "machine learning" is, from a statistical perspective;
  it's just fitting a model's free parameters to some training data! The
  process is the same whether your model is a simple linear one with two
  free parameters or a big, complex neural network with millions of
  free parameters. So, "deep learning" isn't some magical new thing, either;
  it's just using the same model-fitting process to fit a big, complex
  model!
</p>

<p>
  No matter what model we have, the "learning" part is essentially the same:
  fit the model to your training data by minimizing your specified loss
  function. All statistical inferences basically work this way.
</p>

<p>
  From a practical perspective, then, reliable statistical analysis means
  choosing
  the statistical model that is most appropriate for the data and inference
  problem at hand. This is often couched in terms of the "bias-variance
  tradeoff".
</p>

<p>
  Without getting too technical, we can think of there being two primary
  sources of inference error:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Bias error - occurs when your statistical model is too simple for the
    inference problem.
    <p>
      All models make assumptions about the data and the structure of the
      inference problem. For example, a linear model assumes that the data
      follow a straight line. In general, the simpler the model, the more
      assumptions it makes. Any assumption a model makes will "bias" the
      model in some way. For example, a linear model will <em>only</em>
      infer a linear relationship among the data, even if the real relationship
      is non-linear.
      Bias error is sometimes called "underfitting". It can generally
      be alleviated by using a more complex model.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Variance error - occurs when your statistical model is too complex for
    the amount of data you have.
    <p>
      So, why not just use the 'most complex' model available for <em>all</em>
      data analysis? Well, if the model is too complex, it can miss the
      general trends in the data that you want it to find, and instead start
      to fit the random noise in the data. When this happens, the model may
      <em>appear</em> to fit the data <em>extremely</em> well, but it doesn't
      actually tell you anything about the structure of the data and can
      perform very poorly in practice. Variance
      error is often called "overfitting". It can be alleviated by collecting
      more data or by simplifying the model.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Most real-world inference problems are fairly complex.
  Based on the bias-variance tradeoff, we should therefore try to use the
  most complex
  model we can, given the amount of data we have, to avoid underfitting.
  If we have <em>tons</em>
  of data, we can probably avoid overfitting, even if we use a very complex
  model. However, if we have limited data, we will need to use a simpler
  model to avoid overfitting. The 'sweet spot' in the bias-variance tradeoff
  is found when we select a model that avoids both under- and over-fitting,
  given the data we have.
</p>

<p>
  So, what types of models are available to us?
</p>

<p>
  All classical statistical modeling approaches are essentially riffs on
  linear models; they are linear (or nealy-so). Commonly-used t-tests,
  correlations, regressions, ANOVA, Chi-square tests, principle component
  analyses... all basically linear models. These are the <em>simplest</em>
  statistical models we have. They generally perform best when there is
  limited data or the inference problem is very simple. Classical statistical
  models tend not to overfit but will underfit in many cases.
</p>

<p>
  All methods commonly associated with the term "machine learning" are
  essentially extensions of classical statistical modeling approaches that
  introduce structured non-linear components; they are close-to-linear.
  Generalized linear models (yep, linear), fancy regressions like lasso,
  ridge or Bayesian regression, support vector machines, naive Bayes
  classifiers, decision trees, and simple neural networks... all introduce
  'a little bit' of non-linearity into what is basically a linear model.
  These models are a little more complex than classical statistical models.
  They generally perform best with intermediate amounts of data; they can
  overfit when data are limited and underfit when the inference problem
  is highly non-linear.
</p>

<p>
  Deep learning methods based on very large neural networks are different.
  Although the basic neural network component is a simple linear model,
  deep networks typically incorporate a very high degree of non-linearity.
  In fact, it has been known for some time that, under fairly general
  conditions, neural networks can reliably approximate <em>any</em> functional
  form (
  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10472-020-09723-1"
   target="_blank">eg, Kratsios, 2021</a>). Because of their complexity,
  deep learning methods typically require very large amounts of data to
  avoid overfitting. They typically don't underfit.
</p>

<p>
  Below is a very common graph illustrating the relationships among
  classical statistical modeling approaches (ie, linear models), methods
  from machine learning (ie, near-linear models) and deep learning methods.
  This particular graph is from Moolayil (2019, An introduction to deep
  learning and Keras), but there are similar diagrams all over the internet.
</p>

<p>
  The graph plots model performance or accuracy on the Y-axis against data set
  size on the X-axis, assuming that the analysis goes well and avoids gross
  under- or over-fitting errors. The take-home message is that deep learning
  methods are the <em>only</em> approaches we know of that continue to get
  better and better as data set size increases, under real-world conditions.
  At some point, machine learning methods 'saturate' due to their limited
  non-linearity, and giving them more data to analyze doesn't help them to
  provide more reliable inferences. Classical statistical approaches saturate
  at even smaller data set sizes, due to their strong linear constraints.
  However, because deep learning models can essentially approximate
  <em>any</em> complex function, they can reliably identify highly non-linear
  relationships among the data, given enough data to analyze. How much data?
  contemporary deep learning models are commonly trained using 100-million
  data samples or more! We are unlikely to see such large data sets in the
  agricultural or life sciences.
</p>

<img src="media/stats_ml_ai_comparison.jpg" alt="Deep learning beats machine learning beats statistics as we get more data. From Moolayil (2019) An introduction to deep learning and keras" width="500">

<p>
  Of course, what this graph is ignoring is the potential for overfitting
  with complex models. When data sets are very small, it can be
  <em>extremely</em> difficult to avoid overfitting errors, particularly with
  deep learning models. The bias-variance tradeoff ensures that deep learning
  is not <em>always</em> the best method to use for every problem! But, as
  we'll see later on in this course, it is possible to implement many (all?)
  classical statistical models and machine learning models using neural
  networks!
</p>

<h2>So, what is "artificial intelligence", then?</h2>

<p>
  Based on this discussion, I'm going to go out on a limb and provide a
  <em>practical</em> definition of "artificial intelligence" as:
  <em>using very complex neural networks to analyze data</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Please feel free to disagree with my definition; I'm certain many, many
  people will, and they will have good reason to. However, I will say that
  this practical definition has two things going for it.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    It coincides with how professionals working in the field use the term.
    <p>
    If you attend a professional conference on AI or read research papers
    in the field, they will be primarily focused on deep neural networks.
    If you start saying you are doing AI research or using AIs, but you aren't
    using deep neural networks, people in the field are going to start
    looking at you sideways.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Deep neural networks are the <em>only</em> statistical inference methods
    that have ever achieved human-level (or super-human) performance on
    complex inference tasks.
    <p>
    So, if we look back at our original 'semantic'
    definition of AI as 'mimicking natural intelligence', deep neural
    networks are the only methods that actually do that.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Even if you strongly disagree with equating AI with deep neural networks, it's
  clear from even a very casual perusal of the field that neural nets are
  by far the dominant paradigm for doing AI today. Of course, this is likely
  to change in the future, whenever a new methodology comes out that is
  better than deep neural networks. And of course it wasn't always the case
  that neural networks dominated the AI scene.

<h1>A brief history of "artificial intelligence"</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Lest we be doomed to repeat the past.
</h5>

<p>
  The concept of a machine that could interact with humans in a variety
  of situations, essentially as a 'peer', gained widespread popularity through
  1940s science fiction, in which "AIs" were typically portrayed
  as anthropomorphic robots.
</p>

<p>
  By the 1950s, computing theorists were developing the initial ideas that
  computers could 'learn' to 'think' and 'reason' like human beings. Around
  the same time, researchers took inspiration from 'biology' to create the
  first artificial neurons (called "perceptrons"); these simple linear
  computing units could be 'hooked together' to form 'neural networks'.
  Unfortunately, the computing power of the day prevented neural networks
  from being applied to complex problems.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the development of "artificial intelligence" during the 20th
  century relied heavily on the computer's ability to perform highly-repetitive
  tasks accurately and much faster than humans. The main ideas behind
  things like 'logic programming' and 'expert systems' were that, if we
  could somehow 'program' a computer to store a set of 'rules' or 'guidelines'
  that are similar to how a human expert might think about a problem, then
  the computer's speed could be utilized to 'search' through those rules
  very quickly, and thus 'mimic' how a human expert might think.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, researchers quickly found out that it was very difficult to
  quantify a human expert's 'rules' or 'guidelines' into a form that a computer
  could use to perform a specific task. Nonetheless, given enough programmers
  and enough computing power, large 'rule-search' systems could out-compete
  humans at complex decision-making tasks like chess. By the late 1990s,
  computers had won the human-vs-computer meta-chess match.
</p>

<p>
  Around the same time, research in neural networks was re-fueled by the
  re-discovery of a 1960s algorithm that allowed networks of
  interconnected perceptrons to efficiently fit training data. The
  "back propagation algorithm" (still used today!) uses the chain rule
  from calculus to efficiently calculate partial derivatives, allowing
  models to update their parameter values more efficiently, so they can
  fit data with fewer parameter updates.
  Unfortunately,
  computing power still severely limited the size and complexity of neural
  networks.
</p>

<p>
  It wasn't until around 2010 that researchers realized graphics
  processing units (GPUs) could be used to radically speed up neural netowrk
  'training'. GPUs had been around since the 1970s as specialized hardware
  that was responsible for displaying computer-generated graphics on a
  monitor. By the 1990s, GPUs had become sophisticated 'specialized
  computers' generating the rapid succession of images needed for
  2D and 3D video games. Computer graphics generation relies
  heavily on the rapid manipulation of high-dimensional matrices (now called
  "tensors"). Specialized GPU hardware allows tensor manipulations to
  be distributed across a very large number of parallel processors, so
  these manipulations can be performed extremely quickly (ie, in 'real time').
  This 'real time' image generation is needed to support realistic graphics
  in video games, particularly for games having a 3D environment.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly, the same high-speed tensor manipulations used to generate
  realistic video-game worlds can also be used to do linear algebra,
  solve differential equations, and fit statistical models! Once researchers
  realized that GPUs from gaming machines could be used to do math and
  statistics, they wrote special programming libraries that allowed GPUs
  to be programmed just like any other computer. The most widely-used
  such library, CUDA, was introduced by NVIDIA in 2007. With a programming
  interface to the GPU, researchers could now use GPUs to 'speed up'
  mathematical and statistical computations, including the back-propagation
  algorithm used to train neural networks!
</p>

<p>
  The availability of back-propagation on high-speed GPUs was a game-changer
  for neural networks, allowing very large networks with millions of
  parameters to be fit to extremely large data sets in a reasonable amount
  of time (days or weeks vs decades or millenia!). It has been estimated that
  GPUs can train neural networks about 250-times faster than typical CPUs.
</p>

<p>
  The combination of high-speed GPU hardware with availability of very large
  training data sets allowed the complex modeling capabilities of "deep"
  neural networks to really shine. Between around 2010-2015, we saw a dramatic
  increase in the size of 'state-of-the-art' neural networks and a corresponding
  dramatic increase in accuracy on complex inference tasks like image
  recognition and natural language processing. Around this time, neural
  networks started to perform 'as good as' or 'better than' human experts
  at complex inference tasks, basically becoming the first real
  "artificial intelligence" systems.
</p>

<p>
  Since around 2015, neural networks have continued to get bigger and bigger,
  with state-of-the-art models nowadays having hundreds of millions of
  parameters
  or more. These models are typically trained on massive computers with
  parallel arrays of multiple GPU cards using training data sets with hundreds
  of millions or billions of data samples.
</p>

<p>
  But neural network researchers are also realizing that it isn't <em>only</em>
  size that matters. The way neural networks are connected (ie, the neural
  network "architecture") can have a huge impact on their performance.
  Researchers are also devising more complex and specialized neural processing
  units. While the initial perceptron was a simple linear unit, many of the
  neuron 'types' used today are capable of much more complex individual
  computations, including 'memory' and 'attention'.
</p>

<p>
  In our view, the immediate future challenge to neural-network based AI is
  to move beyond their exceptional performance in a handful of very well-studied
  problems and begin developing AI solutions to problems in <em>any</em>
  field. This course will focus on applications in the agricultural and
  life sciences.
