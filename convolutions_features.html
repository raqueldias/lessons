<h1>images and image depth</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  An image can have depth.
</h5>

<p>
  We've been talking about image data as "2 dimensional", and it's certainly
  true that, in a general sense, images have height and width, but no
  'depth'; or do they?
</p>

<p>
  In a computer, an image has to be stored as data using numbers to describe
  each 'pixel' in the image in such a way that the image can be displayed
  on the screen using software. In the case of a black-and-white (aka, "grayscale")
  image, the 'intensity' of each pixel can be adequately described using a
  single numerical value (a scalar). However, in the case of a color image,
  there is no efficient way to 'encode' a pixel's color using only a single
  numerical value. Rather, each pixel's data is encoded as a vector of
  numbers describing the individual values for each 'channel' in the image.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps the 'simplest' pixel encoding for color images contains 3 channels,
  corresponding to the colors: red, green and blue (aka, RGB). In
  this case, each pixel is described using a vector of 3 numerical values,
  which are typically between 0 and 256. The image below shows how a color
  image can be 'made up of' three different 'channels', one for red, one for
  green, and one for blue.
</p>

<img src="./media/rgb.png">

<p>
  When the three channels making up a color image are 'combined' by software,
  the image can be displayed on the screen.
</p>

<p>
  Image 'channels' need to be dealt with when developing or understanding
  convolution neural-network layers. Up until now, we've assumed images have
  a single channel, and that convolution network layers also output a single
  channel. This is obviously not always the case.
</p>

<p>
  In reality, image data are encoded <em>not</em> as a rank-2 tensor (ie,
  a matrix) but as a rank-3 tensor, with the 3rd rank typically used to
  encode the 'channel' data for each pixel in the image. For example, a
  64x64 pixel color image would not be encoded by a tensor of shape (64,64),
  but as a rank-3 tensor of shape (64,64,3). The first two ranks would encode
  the location of each pixel, and the last rank would encode the RGB channel
  data as a 3-dimensional vector.
</p>

<p>
  Even with this added 'twist' to the image data, we still analyze image data
  using "2D" convolutions. However, the convolutions <em>automatically</em>
  incorporate the multiple channels. Very simply, a single convolution
  will <em>independently</em> apply its input weights to <em>each</em> of
  the separate input channels, and then sum over all channel outputs to produce
  the final output from the convolution layer.
</p>

<p>
  The following animations show how a convolution layer 'first' produces
  separate individual outputs for the red, green and blue image channels, and
  then sums the channel outputs.
</p>

<img src="./media/rgbconvolution2.gif" width=600>

<p>
  It's important to remember, however, that these animations describe the
  <em>conceptual</em> steps that occcur in a convolution calculation and do
  not necessarily reflect how the calculations are actually <em>implemented</em>
  in software or hardware.
</p>

<p>
  So, a single convolution "filter" combines information from multiple image
  "channels" to produce a convolution layer's output.

<h1>Convolution filters</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Calculating multiple convolutions from the same input.
</h5>

<p>
  So far, we have been considering a convolution neural network layer
  producing a single 'channel' of outputs that combines information from
  a contiguous 'block' of inputs and any input 'channels'.
</p>

<p>
  In nearly all practical cases, we will want to apply <em>many</em> different
  convolution 'filters' to the same input data. This allows different convolution
  operations to 'specialize' in extracting different types of 'information'
  from the input data, which can be used later on in the neural network.
  For example, some convolution 'filters' might extract the presence of
  horizontal lines in the image data, while other 'filters' might extract
  the presence of vertical lines. Later on in the network, information from
  these different filters can be 'combined' to identify 'higher order'
  image features like rectangles. The extraction of 'higher order' image
  features appears to be important for building convolution neural networks
  capable of reliable complex inferences, such as facial recognition or
  object classification.
</p>

<p>
  We can specify the number of independent convolution "filters" we would
  like to have in a convolution neural-network layer. Each 'filter' has its
  own independent set of convolution neurons that share input weights and
  the bias term and produce an independent output. Each 'filter' combines
  information from <em>all</em> input channels and produces a single output
  'channel'. Collectively, the outputs from <em>all</em> the 'filters' in
  the layer are 'concatenated' (sometimes called "stacked") together to
  generate multiple 'output channels' (although convolution outputs are
  more commonly referred to as "filters", not "channels", which is typically
  only used to refer to primary image data).
</p>

<p>
  For example, if we have an input image of size 64x64, with 3 channels
  (red, green, blue), and we specify a convolution layer with 256 filters,
  the output of the convolution layer will have 256 'dimensions' for each
  pixel, one from the output of each filter. In other words, the shape
  of the input image is (64,64,3), and the shape of the output of the
  convolution layer is (k,k,256), where 'k' is determined by the kernel
  shape used in the convolution layer. For example, if we use a kernel
  shape of (3,3), then the output of the layer would be of shape: (62,62,256).
</p>

<p>
  Of course, we can use the output of one convolution layer as the <em>input</em>
  to another convolution layer. For example, if we send our (62,62,256) output
  as input to a new convolution layer with kernel shape (3,3) and 128 filters,
  the output of our new layer would have shape: (60,60,128).
</p>

<p>
  In any case, the dimension of the <em>last</em> rank in a convolution layer's
  output is <em>always</em> the number of filters specified by the user. The
  dimensions of the other ranks are determined by the shape of the input
  tensor and the shape of the convolution layer's kernel.
