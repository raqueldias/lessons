<h1>What is "overfitting"?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Modeling the <em>noise</em> in the data, rather than the <em>pattern</em>.
</h5>

<p>
  Conceptually, we can think of statistical inference as approximating a
  "target function" mapping explanatory variables "x" to a response variable
  "y":
</p>

<pre class="language-none">
y = f(x)
</pre>

<p>
  In a linear model, we <em>constrain</em> the function approximation to have
  a specific 'form', in this case a 'linear form':
</p>

<pre class="language-none">
y = mx + b
</pre>

<p>
  But with neural network AI, we know from the universal approximation
  theorem that - given an appropriate network - we can reliably approximate
  <em>any</em> arbitrary function "f".
</p>

<p>
  Functions are how we use numbers to 'model' the world in which we live. To
  make quantitative inference possible, we <em>assume</em> that there is
  <em>some</em> unknown function that relates explanatory and response variables
  <em>in the world</em>. Whether this assumption is <em>true</em> or not,
  metaphysically, is beyond the scope of this course. For practical purposes,
  it really doesn't matter one bit whether functions have 'being' in the
  world, because assuming they do allows us to make <em>much</em> more
  detailed and reliable inferences about observable phenomena that we would
  be able to make, otherwise.
</p>

<p>
  Once we make the assumption that there is <em>some</em> function relating
  explanatory to response variables, we can write a general model of
  <em>any</em> finite data set as:
</p>

<pre class="language-none">
y = f(x) + ε
</pre>

<p>
  where "f(x)" is the 'functional pattern' relating or "mapping" explanatory
  variables "x" to the response variables "y", and "ε" refers to the
  "sampling error" associated with using a finite data set to represent what
  is, conceptually at least, a theoretically <em>infinite</em> population of
  data. In practice, the 'error' (ε) can include things like measurement
  error, variation in sample preparation or storage, false or misleading
  information, data entry mistakes, quantum fluctuations due to the inherently
  stochastic nature of the universe, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Conceptually, our model starts <strong>overfitting</strong> when <em>part of the
  'error' becomes part of the 'model'</em>. We could 'write down'
  overfitting as something like this:
</p>

<pre class="language-none">
        _"overfit model"
       |         _"overfit error"
    ___|___   __|
y = f(x+ε1) + ε2
    --- --------
     |         |_"true error"
     |_"true model"
</pre>

<p>
  In this example, we are <em>trying</em> to model the <em>true</em> underlying
  function "f(x)", with <em>true</em> sampling error "ε1 + ε2". But our
  model has "overfit" the training data; it is <em>actually</em> modeling the
  <em>incorrect</em> underlying function "f(x+ε1)", with <em>incorrect</em>
  sampling error "ε2".
</p>

<p>
  The <em>important</em> thing to remember is that, when your model starts
  fitting the <em>error</em> rather than the functional "pattern" in your
  data sample, the model is "overfitting" the data.

<h1>How can I tell when my model is overfitting?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  It doesn't "generalize".
</h5>

<p>
  In practice, contemporary AI is a "inductive learning" paradigm - the
  neural network must 'learn' a "general pattern" (ie, the "target
  function" relating explanatory to response variables) by 'studying'
  specific data samples drawn from that pattern. By 'fitting' the model
  to the data samples, the network 'infers' the target function by adjusting
  its weights and bias parameter values to approximate the 'true' underlying
  target function. In other words, the neural network examines <em>specific
  examples</em> and uses them to infer a <em>general pattern</em>.
</p>

<p>
  A reasonably-sized neural network can 'adjust its weights and bias parameters'
  to approximate nearly <em>any</em> target function, so how can we
  <em>know</em> that our network has inferred the <em>correct</em> target
  function from our data?
</p>

<p>
  When we <em>simulate</em> data, we <em>know</em> the <em>true</em> target
  function with absolute certainty, so we can just compare the function
  inferred by the neural network to the <em>true</em> target function. We
  have been doing this 'by eye' in many of the exercises in this course. But
  we could also use more 'formal' mechanisms to check how closely our
  neural network 'matches' the true target function; for example, we could
  calculate the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence"
  target="_blank">Kullback-Leibler divergence</a> between the trained neural
  network and the 'true' target function, which would tell us roughly how
  'close' our neural network is to the 'true' function.
</p>

<p>
  The power of simulation-based studies is that we <em>know</em> the 'truth'
  with certainty, so we can fairly easily evaluate how <em>good</em> our
  model is doing at 'finding the truth'.
</p>

<p>
  When analyzing 'real' data, we typically don't know the 'true' target
  function, or even an approximation of it (if we did, why would we go
  through the trouble of modeling it?). So, we need to come up with some
  way to determine if our model is 'overfitting', wihout relying on
  'knowing the true answer'.
</p>

<p>
  We will solve this problem using a concept called "generalizability" (ie,
  'the ability to generalize'). Imagine we have collected a data sample from
  the 'true' target function:
</p>

<pre class="language-none">
y = f(x) + ε
</pre>

<p>
 We then fit a neural network model to these data, which gives us an
 <em>approximation</em> of the target function:
</p>

<pre class="language-none">
&ycirc; = g(x)
</pre>

<p>
  So, our neural network is approximating the function "f" using the function
  "g", where "g" is just a 'name' for the function that is 'encoded' by the
  neural network after it has been fit to the data "x". The neural network model
  will generate a 'predicted response' (&ycirc;), given values for explanatory
  variables (x).
</p>

<p>
  How 'good' is our neural-network approximation (g) to the 'true' target
  function (f)? Because we <em>don't</em> know the 'true' target function, we
  can't <em>directly</em> compare the neural-network approximation to the
  'truth'. Also, because the neural network has been <em>trained</em> using
  the data set "x", we can't <em>evaluate</em> our model using the <em>same</em>
  training data.
</p>

<p>
  But what if we could collect a <em>new</em> data set "x2,y2" from the
  <em>same</em> target function "f", and then predict the response "y2"
  from explanatory variables "x2" using the neural-network approximation
  "g" that has already been fit to the <em>original</em> training data "x"?
</p>

<pre class="language-none">
&ycirc;2 = g(x2)
</pre>

<p>
  If the neural network has 'accurately' approximated the 'true' target
  function, then the model's loss on the <em>new</em> data set (x2,y2)
  will be <em>very close to</em> its loss on the <em>original</em> training
  data set (x,y). That is,
</p>

<pre class="language-none">
loss(y, &ycirc;) &#8776; loss(y2, &ycirc;2)
</pre>

<p>
  where "&#8776;" just means 'approximately equal to', and we are using the
  function "loss(y, &ycirc;)" to indicate the loss function between 'true'
  response "y" and 'predicted' response "&ycirc;".
</p>

<p>
  In any case, if the model's 'performance' on the <em>new</em> data set is
  'very close to' its performance on the original training data, we say that
  the model "generalizes" to new data. If the model's performance on the new
  data set is <em>much worse</em> than its performance on the original training
  data, we say that the model does <em>not</em> generalize well; it is "overfit"
  to the training data.
</p>

<p>
  In general (ha ha!), we want to use AI to predict response values from
  <em>new</em> data, so our model <em>must</em> generalize well in order to
  be of use. In other words, generalizability is a <em>necessary</em>
  property of a reliable AI system. However, it is not <em>sufficient</em>
  to ensure our AI is reliable in practice. A neural network can be
  generalizable but also bad. For example, a network that achieves 40%
  accuracy on both training data and <em>new</em> 'validation' data generalizes
  very well... it just makes inaccurate predictions!
</p>

<p>
  In the agricultural and life sciences, collecting <em>new</em> data is
  typically difficult and expensive. So in practice, model generalizability
  is commonly evaluated by dividing the <em>original</em> data set into
  two different portions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>training data</strong> - used to fit the model's parameter
    values (weights and bias terms).</li>
  <li><strong>validation data</strong> - used to <em>evaluate</em> the
    ability of the model to <em>generalize</em> to new data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is important that, when using this technique, we really treat the validation
  data like it was 'new' data collected 'after' fitting the model; we must
  <em>never</em> allow the model to 'cheat' by using the validation data to
  help fit the model. Otherwise, we might <em>think</em> our model is
  generalizing very well, even if it isn't. This can be trickier than it may
  first appear, in practice. For example, say we have 'repeated measures'
  from the <em>same</em> individuals or locations. Then, we need to partition
  <em>all</em> of the samples from each individual or location in
  <em>either</em> the training or the validation set; we can't allow
  <em>different</em> samples from the <em>same</em> individual to be split
  up, so some are in the training set, and some are in the validation set.
  And yes, little problems like this routinely undermine the validity of
  <em>real</em> studies in a wide variety of fields.
</p>

<p>
  The major down-side to partitioning existing data into training and validation
  sub-sets is that now we have <em>less</em>
  training data with which to fit the parameters of our model. More data
  typically results in a better fit, so we are sacrificing model fit when
  we "hold out" some data for model validation. In other words, in order to
  assess the model's generalizability, we have to 'give up' a little bit
  of fitting accuracy.
</p>

<p>
  How do we determine <em>how much</em> data should go in the training vs
  validation set? There's no 'easy' answer, but in general there has been
  a trend of using a <em>smaller</em> proportion of data for model validation,
  especially as the amount of <em>total</em> data increases. While you might
  use 30% or 40% of your data for model validation when you have a data set
  with a few hundred to a few thousand samples, you might only need 10% of
  your data for validation when you have a million samples. You generally want
  to use as <em>much</em> data as possible for model fitting, while still
  having <em>enough</em> validation data to get a reliable estimate of
  your model's generalizability. Exactly what the appropriate 'split' looks
  like for a particular problem will be impacted by the type of data you
  are analyzing, how it was collected, and the complexity of your model.
