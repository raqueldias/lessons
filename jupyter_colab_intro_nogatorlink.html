<h1>What is a jupyter notebook?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  A jupyter notebook combines instructions and text with editable, executable
  Python code.
</h5>

<p>
  In this course, we will be using
  <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">jupyter notebooks</a>
  to manage our programming exercises. Anytime we need to write, edit or
  execute code, we will do so through a jupyter notebook. Skeleton notebooks
  will be provided for every course exercise, so you won't need to write your
  own notebook from scratch. You are free to modify your notebook by adding
  text notes or other informational resources, and you will often be required
  to write, edit and/or execute code directly from your notebook.
</p>

<p>
  Jupyter notebooks are not just for this course; they are a very popular
  mechanism for sharing annotated Python code amongst professionals in a wide
  variety of fields related to computer programming and data science. Once
  you learn to use jupyter notebooks effectively, you can use them to access
  existing content and share your code and data analyses with others.
</p>

<p>
  Although jupyter notebooks are closely associated with the Python programming
  language and widely used in the Python programming community, jupyter
  notebooks can also be used to write, edit, execute and share code written in
  other programming languages. So don't think they are just a 'Python thing'.
</p>

<h1>What is google colaboratory?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Google's colab is a platform for running jupyter notebooks.
</h5>

<p>
  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">Google colaboratory</a>
  or 'colab' is an online platform allowing anyone to access, modify, execute
  and share jupyter notebooks. Google colab connects your jupyter notebooks to
  high-performance computing resources using only a basic web browser, making
  it an incredibly powerful tool that can open the door to high-performance
  computing for users who don't necessarily want to become professional
  programmers.
</p>

<p>
  If you dig a bit deeper, you'll find that google colab is basically just a
  specific instance of a platform called
  <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank">"jupyter hub"</a>, which
  is just a general server for sharing jupyter notebooks. So, google colab
  is a jupyter hub server, and there are other jupyter hub servers that are
  not google colab. Some of the nice things about colab is that it is free
  for public use, provides access to high-performance hardware and integrates
  with github and other repositories that support easy file sharing.

<h1>How do I access the jupyter noteboooks for this course?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  You will need to log into google colab to access and run the course jupyter
  notebooks. Here we'll show you how.
</h5>

<p>
  Let's get started and run your first jupyter notebook through google colab.
</p>

<p>
  In this web page, we'll describe how to log into google colab,
  access this course's first jupyter notebook and run the
  jupyter notebook in colab. I would recommend reading through
  this page in its entirety first, and then work through
  the process on your own, so you can run your first jupyter notebook
  in colab.
</p>

<h2>My first jupyter notebook in colab</h2>

<p>
  To access this course's first jupyter notebook, just click on
  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/bryankolaczkowski/ALS3200C/blob/main/helloworld.ipynb"
   target="_blank">this link</a>.
</p>

<p>
  A new browser tab should open in your web browser, and it should look
  pretty similar to the figure below.
</p>

<img src="media/colab_firstnotebook.png" alt="Google colaboratory with first course notebook" width="600">

<p>
  The first jupyter notebook for this course has the title "welcome to
  jupyter notebooks!". Your background color will likely be different; I
  user a "dark reader" plugin on my browser, which changes the background
  to dark gray, because I dislike bright backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
  The first important thing you'll need to do in google colab is to make sure
  you are logged in using a google account. You can use any google account to
  complete this course. If you have a @gmail.com email address, you probably
  already have a personal google account, which you can use for this course.
  If you don't have an existing google account, you will need to create a new
  personal google account to complete this course.
</p>

<p>
  Look in the upper right-hand
  corner of the google colab page. If you are already logged into
  a google account, you should see your account icon in the upper-right
  corner. If this is the case, you are ready to run the course jupyter
  notebooks.
</p>

<img src="media/colab_loggedin.png" alt="Google colaboratory page showing account icon" width="600">

<p>
  If you see a button labelled "Sign in" in the upper-right corner of the
  google colab page, you will need to log into a valid google account
  in order to access colab and run the course jupyter notebooks.
</p>

<img src="media/colab_signin.png" alt="Google colaboratory page showing sign in button" width="600">

<p>
  To log into colab, click on the "Sign in" button; you'll be taken to the
  google account sign-in
  page. If you have a google account (or many), you should see your google
  accounts listed, and you can choose whichever account you'd like to use to
  complete
  this course. If you don't have an existing google account, you can create
  a new account by following the instructions.
</p>

<img src="media/google_acct_choose.png" alt="Google account sign-in page" width="600">

<p>
  Once you log in, you should see your account icon in the upper-right corner
  of the google colab page, which means you are ready to run
  the jupyter notebook.
</p>

<p>
  The first jupyter notebook for this course is a <em>very</em> simple
  example, which is
  just here to introduce you to jupyter notebooks, google colab, and to
  help you troubleshoot any login problems.
</p>

<p>
This short video demonstrates how to log in to google colab and access
this first jupyter notebook.

<p>
  Please make sure you can log into google colab, access the first course
  jupyter notebook, and read through the notebook and execute the interactive
  python code.
